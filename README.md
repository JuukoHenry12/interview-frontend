Tech Decisions & Assumptions

Next.js – chosen for server-side rendering, API routes, and React-based architecture.

Tailwind CSS – for quick, responsive styling.

Axios – for API calls.

React Icons – for consistent iconography.

NextAuth.js / Session management – to handle authentication.

Assumptions:

Backend API is RESTful and available at BASE_URL.

Users are expected to have modern browsers for full functionality.
